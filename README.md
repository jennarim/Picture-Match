# Introduction
"Picture Match" is a game similar to pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey in that it in-volves placing face parts such as eyes, nose, mouth to a blank face while guessing their correct location. 
The player is allowed to rotate face pieces (images) andplace them at the location they guess fits best.
1. The picture of the desired image is initially shown to the player, alongside other instructions.
2. The face parts are placed and rotated randomly outside the face the user should drag the parts to.
