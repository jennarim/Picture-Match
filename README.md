# Introduction
"Picture Match" is a game similar to pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey in that it in-volves placing face parts such as eyes, nose, mouth to a blank face while guessing their correct location. 
The player is allowed to rotate face pieces (images) andplace them at the location they guess fits best.
1. The picture of the desired image is initially shown to the player, alongside other instructions.
2. The face parts are placed and rotated randomly outside the face the user should drag the parts to.
3. The user can rotate any of the face parts as they select it.
4. Each face part will be bound to follow the userâ€™s cursor.  The moment the user clicks inside the face, then the user has finalized the location.
5. Once all face parts have been finalized, the final result is shown.
6. The user can press R to restart, and continue to play and admire the result.
